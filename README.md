# Hello World 👋
## Welcome to Khai Phan's portfolio


- 🔭 Currently Working for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) as an Application Developer.
- 🌱 Learning Python 🐍.
- 📱  Most comfortable with Java, specifically about Mobile Application.
- 🤔 Looking to expand my knowledge in Mobile Application, especially iOS.
- 💬 Ask me about Mobile Application, Android stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: best way via Facebook, just above there.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love listening to music while coding. Some people find it distracting, but for me, music will help me relax and focus less on the work so I can see more possible solutions. (*sound weird right, but it works*)
- 📷 Favourite and Hobby: I love photographing, especially landscape photograph🧗‍ and aviation spotting✈️.

| ["Simple Banking Application"](https://github.com/phanthanhkhai480/Project/tree/main/Banking%20App%20(IDE))    | Java       | IDE      | A simple application that has multiple functionality such as creating a debit & credit account, deposit and withdraw money, calculate compound interest and calculate tax/tax-free account. This application is most likely similar to interaction with an ATM machine, with less complicated function. Each functionality is written in a seperate method.  |
| ["Travel Application"](https://github.com/phanthanhkhai480/Project/tree/main/Travel%20App%20(Mobile)/TravelApp)         | Java       | Mobile   | An application that provide passengers some functionality such as creating an account for booking a flight & hotel, a calendar to record customer's activity (including bookings that has been booked via the app). To achieve that, a free-version of API was used and a json request link will send to the database, including filter option passenger customizes to refine the search.   |
| ["Chat Messenger UI Enhance"](https://www.figma.com/proto/RmQACSrr3ltHtxBclB5ZXN/BTH745-Prototype?node-id=101%3A140&scaling=min-zoom)    | Unspecified| Web/Mobile | An enhancement I made (and defined) what is an ideal chat application specifically for developer or person who work in IT industry. The application contains multiple design for multiple scenarios possible and interaction between each scenarios as well as interaction for some of the functionality that some normal user might have trouble to understand what it does. The ideal of this application is to create a platform that client, manager and developer can sit on the same group and discuss in a professional environement (rather than Facebook or social media places).
