| Simple Banking Application    | Java       | IDE      | A simple application that has multiple functionality such as creating a debit & credit account, deposit and withdraw money, calculate compound interest and calculate tax/tax-free account. This application is most likely similar to interaction with an ATM machine, with less complicated function. Each functionality is written in a seperate method.  |
| Travel Application            | Java       | Mobile   | An application that provide passengers some functionality such as creating an account for booking a flight & hotel, a calendar to record customer's activity (including bookings that has been booked via the app).
