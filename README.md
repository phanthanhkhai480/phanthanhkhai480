### Project Detail
##### (I am hoping to add more to this section as my work experience going on...)

| Project                       | Language   | Platform | Details                         | 
| ----------------------------- |:----------:|:--------:|--------------------------------:|
| Simple Banking Application    | Java       | IDE      | A simple application that has multiple functionality such as creating a debit & credit account, deposit and withdraw money, calculate compound interest and calculate tax/tax-free account. This application is most likely similar to interaction with an ATM machine, with less complicated function. Each functionality is written in a seperate method.  |
| Travel Application            | Java       | Mobile   | An application that provide passengers some functionality such as creating an account for booking a flight & hotel, a calendar to record customer's activity (including bookings that has been booked via the app). To achieve that, a free-version of API was used and a json request link will send to the database, including filter option passenger customizes to refine the search.   |
| Chat Messenger UI Enhance     | Unspecified| Web/Mobile | An enhancement I made (and defined) what is an ideal chat application specifically for developer or person who work in IT industry. The ["application"](https://www.figma.com/proto/RmQACSrr3ltHtxBclB5ZXN/BTH745-Prototype?node-id=0%3A3&scaling=min-zoom) contains multiple design for multiple scenarios possible and interaction between each scenarios as well as interaction for some of the functionality that some normal user might have trouble to understand what it does. The ideal of this application is to create a platform that client, manager and developer can sit on the same group and discuss in a professional environement (rather than Facebook or social media places).
